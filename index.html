                    amazing results. I have seen him help struggling dissertation writers shine, and have seen
                    him
                    work with undergraduates to create papers that fully meet instructors’ requirements. He
                    helps
                    candidates create resumés that work, and can guide anyone through the intricacies of APA

                </summary>
                <ul> Properly editing and proofreading academic papers requires 15 to 20 minutes per page. Each sentence
                    will
                    be read three times: once for grammar, word choice, syntax, punctuation, and spelling; once for APA
                    use;
                    and once to gauge the flow between the previous and the subsequent sentence. Each source will be
                    checked
                    to verify it is in the references and vice versa. <br>
                    <br>
                    When working together on Path 1 or Path 2, we will develop your capstone project from the beginning
                    as you move forward with your chair and committee regarding the content. We will set
                    up monthly meetings to go over any progress and questions, and make sure to adhere to all APA and
                    institutional requirements.
